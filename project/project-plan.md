## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Influence of Population and Density on Airbnb Listings and Pricing in US Cities

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Do cities with larger populations have more Airbnb listings?
2. Does higher population density correlate with higher average Airbnb prices?
3. How does population density affect room type preferences (e.g., shared vs. private rooms)?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Airbnb has transformed the hospitality industry, but factors driving variations in listings and pricing remain underexplored. This project investigates the influence of population size and density on Airbnb activity in US cities. Using datasets combining Airbnb metrics (e.g., listing count, average price, room types) with demographic data (population and density), I aim to uncover relationships that could reveal new market insights.

The project will analyze whether cities with larger populations have more Airbnb listings and if higher density correlates with increased prices or specific room type preferences. Insights from this study could benefit hosts by identifying demographic factors that influence Airbnb market dynamics. This analysis uses data processing and visualization techniques to deliver a clear, data-driven conclusion.
