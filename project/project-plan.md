# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Sectoral Carbon Footprint in North America.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. Which sectors contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions in North America?
2. How do emissions vary across geographic locations of North America?
3. Are there identifiable trends in emissions within specific sectors of North America?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Greenhouse gas emissions from various industrial sectors in North America represent an important environmental challenge, as they contribute significantly to climate change and air quality degradation. This project analyzes the carbon footprint of key sectors using data from the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). By categorizing and quantifying emissions from facilities across industries and geographic locations, this study employs comparative analysis methods to identify which sectors are the largest emitters and how emissions are distributed regionally.

The results can provide insights into high-impact sectors that contribute most to greenhouse gas emissions, supporting efforts to prioritize emission-reduction strategies. This information is valuable for policymakers aiming to create targeted regulations and for industry leaders looking to reduce environmental impact. Ultimately, the findings could guide more effective interventions in reducing North America’s industrial carbon footprint, aligning with sustainability goals and climate action initiatives.

* Data Type: Mutiple CSV files

The EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) provides data on greenhouse gas emissions from large facilities across various sectors in the United States. Facilities report emissions annually, covering gases such as CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O, alongside industry-specific details like location and production activities. This dataset supports environmental monitoring and policy-making, helping to track and manage emissions sources for regulatory and sustainability efforts.
